## Cloning
We're working on making this easier, but for now, if you'd like to duplicate this site for your own city:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Set up a new Google Form that saves data to [a Google Sheet with these headers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQuZugxK6PwsMWUTHFrWxF7xZ0mmlkIcNLLQ4H8LWjflx_JpPi1804_BgKp-KLNnScVnmcmant9DDmp/pubhtml?gid=1536693349&single=true)
3. Set your Google Sheet to publish to a CSV
4. Insert the URL [to the CSV here](https://github.com/noahmanger/pdxtipjar/blob/master/src/components/constants.js#L2)
